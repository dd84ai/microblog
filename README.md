it helped me to learn how to work with Flask in Python from level... I used python a little bit before...to deploying my own web server on Linux Server through regular means, plus with Docker and Herocku ways.

The most awesome, that all it took, five days. I skipped some chanpters though. around 4 or 5?
anyway. I really appreciate the guy who wrote the guide. It is useful to learn something realllly fast.
